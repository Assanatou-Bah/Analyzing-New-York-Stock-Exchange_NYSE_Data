In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to calculate summary statistics, draw inference from the statistics, calculate business metrics, and used models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. 



### Description
The goal of this project is to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

Tasks Performed:
 
1. Analyzed the data and created a presentation to share findings.

2. Developed a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement. 

3. Created a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.  



### Dataset used
The NYSE dataset is a real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. It is a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. Udacity provided a smaller subset of the data that is used for this project.

Ticker symbol: Stock symbol

Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
